# LilyGO T-Deck Plus HA Controller

This repo tracks the ESPHome controller work for LilyGO T-Deck Plus.

Current priorities:

1. Preserve the known-good manual-rendered baseline.
2. Improve UI/UX without destabilizing display/touch/input.
3. Add GPS entity support.
4. Improve keyboard backlight wake behavior while preserving manual `Alt+B`.
5. Maintain a single drop-in install YAML for ESPHome/HA.

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for structure and conventions.
